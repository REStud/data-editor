# Replicate a paper

Replication packages for papers accepted for publication after May 1, 2020 are hosted on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/restud-replication/?page=1&size=20). Papers published in or before 2020 have a link to "Supplementary Data" on the [publisher's website](https://academic.oup.com/restud).

Please reach out to the [Data Editor]({{ site.baseurl }}/editor/) if you need any assistance with replicating any of our published work.
