# Best practices for reproducible research
Reproducible research is helpful not only for readers but also for authors sharing their work. We also recognize the costs of complying with our Data Availability Policy. To minimize the burden on you, the Data Editors of the **American Economic Association** ([Lars Vilhuber](https://www.vilhuber.com/lars/)), the **Economic Journal** ([Joan Llull](http://pareto.uab.cat/jllull/)), the **Canadian Journal of Economics** ([Peter Morrow](https://sites.google.com/view/petermmorrow/home)) and the **Review of Economic Studies** ([Mikl√≥s Koren](https://koren.mk)) are coordinating reproduciblity requirements and guidelines. 

Please see the [common guidance of Social Science Data Editors here](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/).
